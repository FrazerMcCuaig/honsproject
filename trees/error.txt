SEVERE: The initial model is invalid because state has a zero probability.

If the log likelihood of the tree is -Inf, this may be because the
initial, random tree is so large that it has an extremely bad
likelihood which is being rounded to zero.

Alternatively, it may be that the product of starting mutation rate
and tree height is extremely small or extremely large.

Finally, it may be that the initial state is incompatible with
one or more 'hard' constraints (on monophyly or bounds on parameter
values. This will result in Priors with zero probability.

The individual components of the posterior are as follows:
The initial posterior is zero:
  CompoundLikelihood(compoundModel)=(
    LogNormal(kappa)=-1.8654,
    MultivariateDistributionLikelihood(dirichletDistribution)=1.7918,
    Exponential(alpha)=-0.3069,
    CTMCScalePrior(ctmcScalePrior)=-360688.4475,
    LogNormal(bdss.birthRate)=-2.0385,
    Uniform(bdss.relativeDeathRate)=0.0,
    LogNormal(bdss.psi)=-30.8125,
    LogNormal(bdss.origin)=-2.0385,
    BirthDeathSerialSamplingModel/bdss(treeModel)=-Inf,
    StrictClockBranchRates(strictClockBranchRates[branchRates])=0.0
    Total = -Infinity

    TreeDataLikelihood(TreeDataLikelihood[treeLikelihood])=-135461.748
